# Ionic-MuSA

Mobile application for the [Museum of Art (MuSA)](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Museo-de-Arte-RUM-MUSA/385132481629639?fref=ts) at the [University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez](www.uprm.edu)

## About
The mobile application allows for the users to view general information about the museum, view the collection (objects and exhibitions)
available at the museum, scan qr codes next to a museum object in order to access more information on the spot. Users can also view the map of the museum
as well as link their Facebook account to participate in Match Hunts. Match Hunts are basically a game in which the application shows the user a random
cropped image from an object in the museum, consequently the user scans qr codes in order to find a matching object for points which are used to compete with other museum visitors.
